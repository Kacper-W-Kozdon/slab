## Description

This project ports [simulation of the pencil beam in a diffusing slab by Contini](https://github.com/andreafarina/SOLUS/blob/44f188b78a61262fc9eab0ea0b0db7a661dc9f7e/src/fwd/Contini1997.m) and replaces the Green's function of the Diffusion Equation with the Green's function of the Radiative Transfer Equation from [Paaschens (1997)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.56.1135).

The pencil beam is obtained by summing up the contributions from the lattice of positive and negatives image delta sources. Look [Fabrizio Martelli et al. (2009)](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ECBO-2009-7369_1B).
